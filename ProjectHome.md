Based on our experience of software development and scientific research, conclusions about advantages of using visual modelling during development of large software products were made. Not only Unified Modelling Language but also custom-specific diagrams are used in this proccess.
The goal of our project is to create a set of diagram editors, extandable with new model types, and a kit of programming technologies based on methodologies of visual modelling and automatic code generation. Technologies of developing information system, design of mobile applications and generation of business processes for document-flow systems are being developed in our team. The working technology prototype was made and some projects were constructed using it.
The main products are:

1. Set of graphic modelling tools that support UML 2.2 and BPEL (under LGPL licence).
2. Metaeditor that would be used to create custom domain-specific diagrams.
3. Posibility to use light version of our technology as a online service.
4. Full-functional technology version integrated into Visual Studio and Eclipse SDKs.
